# [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) Solutions

I'll be ramping up my C++ this year. 

I am still extremely busy with work, and my blog hasn't seen an article in years at this point.
So I'll be happy just finishing this year.

As always, wish me luck!

ALL DONE! Learned a lot about modern C++, very powerful though very differently from Python.

As usual, see you next year!
